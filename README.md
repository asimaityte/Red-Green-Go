Red-Green-Go
=============

Red-Green-Go! is a board-game-inspired coaching activity, designed to introduce the agile practices of test-driven development and ping-pong pairing. The aim is to allow learners to experience the flow of the TDD style of development on a small but real example, in a short amount of time, without needing lots of guidance and hand-holding.
